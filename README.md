#Disclaimer
This code is not entirely mine. I used the code from https://fable.io/repl/ (Sample Pacman)
as a base and then built upon it. The end result is a mixed code, some mine and some Fable's. 

#Function
This is an F# simple reinforcement learning project. It is the game of Pacman
where the ghosts learn to capture the Pacman using a common ruleset. Learning occurs by picking the best ruleset.

# Instructions

##Choice 1: Run online
This is the easiest choice of the two and also recommended for fast results. For developers that wish to work on the code choice 2
is more suitable.

Step 1: Go to https://fable.io/repl/
Step 2: Select the text file of your choice. All codes are functional and they represent different stages of my project.
Step 3: Copy-paste the code on the left screen of the FABLE repl and press compile
Step 4: Observe results and feel free to modify code or explore it more. 

##Choice 2: Run locally
This is the more difficult solutions which is more suitable if you want to develop on the code.
Go to https://fable.io/ and follow the instructions on the "Getting Started" section.
Open a Project in an IDE and install the .nuget packages that are required (usually Fable.Core,Fable.Browser (all of them))
